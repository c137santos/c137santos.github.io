# Clara Santos

I am Clara Santos. A full-stack software developer and former lawyer. Yes, I made a career transition. But why?

In search of more freedom and creativity, I left my legal career in Faria Lima (S√£o Paulo) to dive into the tech industry. In law, it takes a long time to see our impact on society, whereas in technology we work with MVP and constant improvements.

I am more inclined towards backend development, although I was trained to be a full-stack developer. I enjoy writing automated tests (they make me feel more secure).

Due to my previous career, I have a knack for writing, am good at documentation and producing structured knowledge (have you seen my Medium?), reading documentation, and I have knowledge of laws such as LGPD and startup laws.
